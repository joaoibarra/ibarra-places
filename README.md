# ibarra-places

Ibarra Places is a small app that uses the [Zomato Api](https://developers.zomato.com/). I used the MVVM architecture with Koin dependency injection. Also, I created tests using Espresso and Kappuccino.

### Libs and Tools ###

* [Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin): A lightweight dependency injection framework written in pure Kotlin, using functional resolution only: no proxy, no code generation, no reflection.
* [Retrofit 2.0](http://square.github.io/retrofit/): A type-safe HTTP client for Android made by the Gods
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room): Using Sqlite on Android has always been a problem. The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access.
* [Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging): The Paging Library helps you load and display small chunks of data at a time.
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide): Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
* [Kappuccino](https://github.com/concretesolutions/kappuccino): A framework to simplify the way you do instrumentation tests in your app, using Espresso and Kotlin.
* [MockWebServer](https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/mockwebserver): A scriptable web server for testing HTTP clients
* [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions): GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub.
* [Instrumetation Test Robots](https://academy.realm.io/posts/kau-jake-wharton-testing-robots/): robot pattern allows you to create stable, readable, and maintainable tests with the aid of Kotlinâ€™s language features.
